# If your program doesn't work correctly, do the following:

### 1. Import all the needed libraries, methods, etc..
### 2. If it is not installed, install the jar file, which is located in the `jar_files` folder (If you can't install the file by yourself, look it up on `Google`)
### 3. If everything is installed correctly, the program should execute flawlessly.


## When testing:
- run the program and type in your information into the text entries.
- when you hit the `Save` button, your **CV** should appear in the project folder. **(It will have your name in the filename)**
